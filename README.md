# 0x00. Fix my code

## Background Context
Fix my code is a new type of project, where weâ€™ll jump into an existing code base and fix it!

Sometimes we will know the language, sometimes not.

The repository 0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge contains initial files for all solutions.

We should not recode everything, just fix it!
